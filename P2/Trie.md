# Building a Trie in Python

In order to find all the suffixes in a Trie dictionary, I used a recursive function to iterate through the items of the dictionary. In each iteration, I called the function again and appended a results array with the character and suffix (in the form of a returned partial array from the recursive function). Creating a new array for every node in the children, this algorithm has a space complexity of O(n) and a time efficiency of O(n).
